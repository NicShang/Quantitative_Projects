# üß† Drawdown Risk Classifier for Superannuation Portfolios

This project simulates a diversified superannuation (pension) portfolio inspired by Cbus Super‚Äôs publicly disclosed asset allocations. The aim is to construct a predictive framework to classify periods where the portfolio is at risk of experiencing a significant drawdown (e.g., >10% within 20 trading days).

## üîç Why NAV, not just volatility?

While volatility (standard deviation) is a common risk metric, it fails to capture **cumulative losses, sustained downtrends, and tail events**. In real-world portfolio oversight‚Äîespecially for retirement funds‚Äîrisk is not about daily noise but whether the portfolio enters a **prolonged drawdown**.

> üìà This project constructs the **portfolio-level NAV series** as the foundation for evaluating drawdowns, stress regimes, and tail-risk exceedance‚Äîsomething volatility alone cannot detect.

## üì¶ Project Overview

- ‚úÖ Simulate multi-asset super fund portfolio NAV using ETF proxies (VAS.AX, IVV, VAF, VNQ, IFRA, IEM, AAA)
- ‚úÖ Generate future 20-day rolling drawdown as the basis for classification
- ‚úÖ Create engineered features (5-day return, 20-day return, 20-day volatility)
- ‚úÖ Train logistic regression and gradient boosting models to predict drawdown events
- ‚úÖ Evaluate classification performance (precision, recall, ROC-AUC)

## üß∞ Tools & Techniques

- `Python`, `pandas`, `yfinance`, `scikit-learn`, `plotly`
- Portfolio NAV construction
- Labeling regime risk via rolling max drawdown
- Logistic Regression / XGBoost classification
- Model explainability (planned: SHAP)

## üß© Key Insight

> Portfolio NAV is the foundation of risk truth in long-horizon investing.  
> This project demonstrates how downside-aware models can complement volatility models by **anticipating actual portfolio stress**, not just noise.
