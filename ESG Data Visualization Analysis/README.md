# ESG Data Visualization | Clean Energy Transition Dashboard

A data visualization project built to transform raw ESG indicators into executive-ready insights for decision-makers and stakeholders involved in sustainability, energy access, and policy planning.

## Objective

To structure and present key clean energy transition patterns across countries using real-world ESG data, emphasizing the potential of data-driven diagnostics in strategic reporting and resource allocation. Key focuses include:

- Gaps in electricity access between rural and urban populations
- Patterns in renewable energy consumption growth
- Emission intensity and sustainability-related risk indicators

## Business Relevance

This project simulates the role of a quant analyst supporting environmental data advisory. It demonstrates how unstructured sustainability datasets can be cleaned, modeled, and visualized to:

- Inform investment committees or government bodies on infrastructure priorities
- Identify ESG-related risks and opportunities across regions or sectors
- Enhance regulatory and sustainability reporting through dynamic, stakeholder-friendly outputs

By enabling a high-level overview with the ability to drill down by geography and metric, this project aligns with the practical demands of ESG strategy design, transparency, and compliance support.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, geopandas, folium  
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Visualization Techniques**:
  - Choropleth maps
  - Pairwise correlation matrices
  - Time series line plots
  - Bar and scatter plots with categorical breakdowns

## Key Features

- Designed for interpretability, with visuals structured for non-technical audiences
- Modular pipeline for data cleaning, feature engineering, and plotting
- Scalable structure for future ESG dimensions (e.g., social or governance layers)
- Built with reusability in mindâ€”suitable for integration into reporting workflows or internal dashboards

## Future Extensions

- Automated reporting with scheduling (e.g., via Airflow)
- UI-based dashboarding (e.g., Streamlit or Power BI)
- Integration with firm-level ESG scoring models or sustainability indices
