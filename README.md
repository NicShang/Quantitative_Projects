# Visa Inc. Risk Modelling Project

This project was developed as part of a university financial time series course. The goal was to assess portfolio risk and volatility for Visa Inc. using AR-GARCH modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, and VaR/Expected Shortfall forecasting.

    ## Key Components
    - üìä AR-GARCH volatility modeling using `arch` and `statsmodels`
    - üéØ VaR and Expected Shortfall calculations across 1-, 10-, and 22-day horizons
    - üß† Python automation pipeline with traceable risk metric generation
    - üìà Market data pre-processing from historical Visa Inc. stock prices
    
    ## Skills Demonstrated
    - Time series forecasting under real-world pressure
    - Translating volatility into actionable risk insights
    - Presenting risk metrics to simulated "hedge fund stakeholders"


# Black-Scholes Option Pricing (CQF Coursework)

This project implements a closed-form Black-Scholes-Merton model for pricing European call and put options using Python. The model was developed as part of my CQF (Certificate in Quantitative Finance) learning journey, focusing on applying derivatives pricing theory in a practical, code-driven environment.

      ## üîç Key Features
      
      - Closed-form valuation of European call and put options
      - Adjustable parameters: spot price, strike price, risk-free rate, volatility, and time to maturity
      - Built using core libraries: `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `Matplotlib`

      ## üß† Learning Objectives
      
      - Understand the theoretical basis of the Black-Scholes model
      - Translate financial theory into executable Python code
      - Explore the sensitivity of option prices to key input variables
