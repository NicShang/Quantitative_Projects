While volatility is often used as a proxy for risk, it fails to capture the directional and cumulative nature of real portfolio losses. In this project, portfolio NAV was constructed from weighted ETFs to reflect the behavior of a diversified superannuation portfolio. This NAV series allows for more relevant risk metrics such as maximum drawdown, recovery duration, and rolling tail-risk exceedance, which are more aligned with institutional risk oversight than standard deviation alone.
