# ETF Portfolio Optimization | Finance Capstone Project  
University of Sydney | 2024  

This project simulates a real-world ETF portfolio construction and optimization process, reflecting the logic used in institutional investment mandates. Developed in Python, it integrates quantitative techniques and reporting practices commonly used in fund strategy, portfolio analytics, and client reporting roles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
To construct a CPI+6% risk-adjusted ETF portfolio using a core-satellite strategy and optimize asset allocation under regulatory constraints and Sharpe maximization objectives.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features  
- **Core-Satellite Allocation**: 65% core, 35% satellite ETF exposure  
- **Return Target**: CPI + 6% expected return  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Total weight = 100%  
  - Core â‰¥ 65%  
  - Satellite ETF â‰¤ 15% each  
- **Mandate Compliance**: Reflects real mandates (e.g., CFS fixed income strategy)

---

## ðŸ§  Technical Highlights  
- **Python Tools**: NumPy, SciPy.optimize, Matplotlib, Plotly  
- **Sharpe-Max Portfolio Optimization**: Constraint-based mean-variance optimization  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 5,000 random weight simulations to evaluate return/volatility trade-offs  
- **Efficient Frontier Visualization**: Dynamic risk-return mapping  
- **Scenario Testing**: Stress-tested return and Sharpe sensitivity

---

## ðŸš€ Transferable Skills  
- Portfolio modeling and return attribution  
- Regulatory constraints encoding  
- Python-based scenario diagnostics  
- Risk/return trade-off interpretation  
- Communicating model outputs in fund reporting language

> Efficient frontier plotted with Sharpe-max solution  
> Optimization weights table under constraints  
> Return distribution and downside risk profile
