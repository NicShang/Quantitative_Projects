# ETF Portfolio Optimization | Finance Capstone Project

This project simulates a $5 million ETF portfolio construction aligned with CPI+6% return objective, using a core-satellite allocation framework. It mirrors real-world fund operations including portfolio modeling, scenario simulation, and constraint handling.

## Key Objectives

- Design a diversified portfolio of ASX-listed ETFs that meets both return and risk constraints.
- Align portfolio construction with client mandates such as strategic/tactical allocation ranges, ETF weight limits, and sector diversification.
- Simulate return and risk using Monte Carlo methods, stress-test allocations, and visualize trade-offs.

## Key Features

- ✅ Python-based optimizer using `scipy.optimize` and `NumPy`  
- ✅ Constraint-aware design (e.g., 65–85% core, max 10% per ETF)  
- ✅ Monte Carlo simulation for Sharpe-max selection  
- ✅ Front-end HTML visualization and investor reporting format

## Skills Highlight

- Portfolio construction under real-world constraints  
- Efficient frontier visualization  
- Sharpe ratio maximization and return variance analysis  
- Practical experience with Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly
