# M&A Valuation Simulation – Microsoft Acquires Activision Blizzard  
📊 Academic Deal Simulation | University of Sydney | 2024  

This project is a **simulated M&A advisory case** for Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, conducted as part of the postgraduate Corporate Finance curriculum (FINC6017) at the University of Sydney.

It replicates the end-to-end M&A workflow—covering valuation, synergy analysis, capital structuring, and strategic recommendations—using Excel-based models and investor-style presentation materials.

- 🔍 Conducting **comparable company and transaction analysis** using EV/EBITDA and revenue multiples  
- ⚙️ Modelling **synergies and EPS accretion/dilution** under integration assumptions  
- 🧾 Supporting board-facing materials in the form of a **client-style pitch presentation**  
- 🗂️ Simulating execution steps including **NDA, CIM prep, and Q&A tracking**
