# ESG Data Visualization | Clean Energy Transition Dashboard

This project visualizes global ESG indicators related to clean energy access, usage, and environmental sustainability. Built using Python, the dashboard is designed to support policymakers and development organizations in understanding clean energy transitions across countries.

##  Objective

To present an executive-ready summary of energy transition patterns using real-world ESG data â€” with a focus on:

- Electricity access gaps between rural and urban populations
- Renewable energy consumption trends
- Emissions intensity and sustainability risk indicators

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, geopandas, folium
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Visualization Types**:
  - Bar and scatter plots
  - Choropleth maps
  - Pairwise correlations
  - Temporal trend analysis

##  Key Visual Insights

- **Access vs. Infrastructure Time**: Countries with long delays in electricity provision generally show lower rural access rates.
- **Renewables vs. Emissions**: Developed countries often lead in renewable adoption but also contribute heavily to GHG emissions.
- **Regional Hotspots**: Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia show consistently lower performance on clean energy indicators.

##  Methodology

- Cleaned missing data and normalized cross-country indicators
- Grouped countries by income levels and regions (e.g., OECD vs. non-OECD)
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover policy-relevant patterns
- Used interactive visualizations and geospatial mapping to enhance impact
